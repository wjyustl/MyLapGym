OTHER COMMENTS :

The plugin include:
 - CarvingManager handling carving operations between a tool and an object. 
   The CarvingManager class will perform topological resection on a triangle surface (could be on top of tetrahedron topology)
   The tool performing the carving as well as the object to carved need to be represented by collision models
   Detecting the collision is done using the scene Intersection and NarrowPhaseDetection pipeline.
 - 2 simples scenes showing a sphere carving a cylinder volume with different parameters
 - A scene showing how to use the carving Manager on a tool object model.
